# This is an example data file for the physics lab report.
# You should create a data.yaml file in the same directory.
# To generate the data file, submit photos of your lab report to an AI agent,
# Alongside the prompt defined in main.ipynb.

# The sole purpose of this file is to showcase the expected structure of data.yaml.
